                              Written by:Ankit Kumar Gupta (12CS10006)      

I have included 7 test files to test Tiny C program

instructions to use Tiny C compiler 
1. use make to generate executable file for Tiny C compiler that converts a c programm into assembly programm
2. use make clean to clean up all generated files
3. for testing a file 
  
after doing make do the following
 

         (./a.out file_name ) here file_name is name of the file to be tested
for ex. to test ass6_12CS10006_test1.c
./a.out  ass6_12CS10006_test1.c   do this

after doing this various files gets generated 

a.  ex. ass6_12CS10006_tokens_1.c contains tokens
b.  ex. ass6_12CS10006_quads_1.c contains symbol table and quads
c.  ex. ass6_12CS10006_test  contains target assembly code


now to test target assembly code

use make Test in terminal 
after doing that do
./test.out
